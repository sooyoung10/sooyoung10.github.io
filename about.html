		“remember the kim family motto: to be able to survive anywhere no matter what,” my dad reminded me many times.
	</p>

	<p>
		since i was a little boy, i’ve been “training” all my life to survive anywhere no matter what.<br/>
		the sahara? no problem: my family never turned on the air conditioner in case we move to a scorching desert.<br/>
		the himalayas? all prepared: going on 9 mile hikes has been a staple of the kim family vacations.<br/>
		a tsunami? no sweat: ever since running a 5 km marathon as a 4 year old, i’ve trained enough to outrun it...<br/>
		or, at least, this is what my parents claimed whenever i complained about our “training.” 
	</p>

	<p>
		back then, i didn’t understand why we had to train for such extreme situations because those were not in our foreseeable future.
	</p>
		but looking back now, the seemingly pointless training prepared me with the mental and physical strength to overcome any adversities i may face.
	<p>
		now i can survive anywhere no matter what.
	</p>
